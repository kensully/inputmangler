##01## Introduction ######

inputmangler is a daemon, running in userspace, that intercepts and transforms linux input events, depending on the active window.
It aims to be highly configurable, reliable and not too hard to use. You can use it to remap those extra mouse buttons, properly utilize a Footswitch or even remap your second keyboard to trigger all kinds of shortcuts! And you can have a different configuration for each window!
It is also capable of translating Text from the network to key presses.

So how does it work?
First of all: it completely bypasses X!
This is done for following reasons:
1. In my experience, applications that generate X events do not work reliably with all applications, especially those in full-screen mode.
2. As X may become obsolete (I certainly hope so) in the near future, I'd rather write something that doesn't need to be rewritten soon.
3. That way it can be used without X running as well.
4. I *hate* working with the X API :( - i really tried, but when i couldn't reliably get the window title after -i don't know how many- hours, even using a code example from the internet that was supposed to do *exactly* what i wanted, i really had enough of that #&%!!.

So what it actually does, is grabbing input events at their device files in /dev/input and using a custom kernel module to generate new input events inside the kernel.
Also, it does not directly talk to X about changes of the current window, but instead offers a D-Bus interface which can be used by the window manager to inform inputmangler about these.
While writing this, I am completely aware that except for the kde-window-manager and xmonad there might not be any window managers actually capable of doing that. See the section on configuring your desktop (#04#) for alternatives.


##02## Requierements ######
Basic:
qt5 (with support for dbus, xml, network)
linux-headers
cmake

On Ubuntu do
$ sudo apt-get install cmake qtbase5-dev linux-headers


To use window specific settings:
With KDE: no additial requirements
With xmonad: probably   qdbus
With other desktop environments / window managers probably   qdbus xdotool x11-utils

$ sudo apt-get install qdbus xdotool x11-utils


##03## Installation ######
